## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
For future releases

Enhance testing capabilities and ensure high code quality.

Improve deployment orchestration and implement rollback mechanisms for error handling.

Integrate DAST scans into deployment pipelines for continuous security testing.

Blue-Green Deployment:
Implement blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime deployments.
Automate switching between active and inactive environments.

Rollback Automation:
Develop automated rollback mechanisms to revert deployments in case of failures.
Implement version control and tagging for easier rollback management.
